# Deep Residual Networks

This repository contains an implementation of an 18-layer Deep Residual Network from "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition", written by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun. The research paper can be found at the following link https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385

### Prerequisites

A Keras installation is required to run this implementation.

## Getting Started

This ResNet can be applied to any image classification dataset. Read the documentation in resnet.py for usage details.

The train.py file contains example usage of the ResNet with the cifar10 dataset


## Built With

* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - The Python Deep Learning Library
